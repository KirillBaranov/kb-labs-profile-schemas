## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** >= 18.18.0
- **pnpm:** >= 9.0.0

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kirill-baranov/kb-labs-profile-schemas.git
cd kb-labs-profile-schemas

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development mode
pnpm dev
```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow **ESLint** and **Prettier** rules configured in the project
- Use **TypeScript strict mode** for all new code
- Run `pnpm lint` before committing changes
- Use `pnpm lint:fix` to automatically fix formatting issues

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality using **Vitest**
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Run `pnpm test` to execute all tests
- Use `pnpm test:watch` for development
- Ensure all schemas are validated against test fixtures

### Schema Development

- Each schema package in `packages/` should be self-contained
- Follow the existing package structure and naming conventions
- Update package README files when adding new functionality
- Ensure all packages build successfully with `pnpm build`
- Maintain backward compatibility for schema changes
- Validate schemas against test fixtures before committing

### Commit Messages

Use clear, conventional commit messages:

```bash
feat: add new profile schema for web applications
fix: correct validation rules for backend profiles
docs: update schema documentation
test: add unit tests for profile validation
refactor: simplify schema structure
```

### Architecture Decisions

- For significant architectural changes, create an **ADR** (Architecture Decision Record) in `docs/adr/`
- Follow the existing ADR format and numbering scheme
- Document the decision rationale and alternatives considered

## üîÑ DevKit Integration

This project uses `@kb-labs/devkit` for shared tooling configurations. Key points:

- **Configurations**: ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, TypeScript, and GitHub Actions are managed by devkit
- **Local configs**: Act as thin wrappers over devkit configurations
- **Updates**: When devkit is updated, run `pnpm install` to get the latest configurations
- **Customization**: For project-specific rules, extend devkit configs rather than overriding them

### DevKit Commands

- `pnpm devkit:sync` - Sync DevKit configurations (runs automatically on install)
- `pnpm devkit:check` - Check if sync is needed
- `pnpm devkit:force` - Force sync (overwrites existing configs)
- `pnpm devkit:help` - Show help and available options

For more details, see [ADR-0005: Use DevKit for Shared Tooling](docs/adr/0005-use-devkit-for-shared-tooling.md).
